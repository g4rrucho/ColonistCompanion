    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 15, 2025</p>

    <p>
      Colonist Companion is a browser extension designed for
      <a href="https://colonist.io" target="_blank">Colonist.io</a> players. It
      tracks in-game information such as opponent resources, development card
      usage, and dice statistics <strong>only</strong> during 1v1 games.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      This extension does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any
      personally identifiable information, authentication credentials, financial
      data, health data, or location information.
    </p>
    <p>
      All processing is done locally within your browser. Game-related data is
      read only from the Colonist.io game page you are currently playing on, and
      is not sent to any external server.
    </p>

    <h2>Permissions Justification</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Host permission</strong> is required for
        <code>https://colonist.io/*</code> so the extension can read in-game
        messages and update its interface in real time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tabs permission</strong> is used only to detect if a Colonist.io
        game tab is active, so the extension can communicate with it.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Code</h2>
    <p>
      Colonist Companion does not use remote code. All functionality is bundled
      into the extension package distributed via the Chrome Web Store.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes in our extension or
      due to regulatory requirements. Any updates will be posted on this page
      with a revised "Last Updated" date.
    </p>
